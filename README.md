Knowbaby
=============
  We all have tiny babies in our home.
  But there is problem:
  The set of things that babies know is identical with the empty set.
  The solution? Let us teach your baby.
  But what should you teach baby?
  Many companies will want to teach your baby, but which to trust? Many baby teaching corporations are un-ethical and fraught with ignorance.
  People want to teach your baby to recognize cute animals. We can do that, but why stop there?

  Why not teach your baby the things that it really needs to know? Why not give your baby a head start on its cultural education?

  Already, your baby can recognize reality TV Stars and corrupt politicians, but can they recognize the author of the The Critique of Pure Reason? They probably Kant. But if you start early with Knowbaby, soon your baby will understand obtuse philosophy jokes like that one I just made.
